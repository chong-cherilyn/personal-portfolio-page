          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            I started working toward my final high-school years from 1995 as a
            casual employee for Edgars. I was as a service centre operator (SCO)
            in the credit office and sales floor at the Southgate branch. I
            planned to work my way up through the organisation. I have since
            worked in retail, IT security, long-term insurance and banking.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Most recently, I was employed as a BA specialist at Nedbank, both as
            a senior business analyst and BA lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to that, I was an enterprise architect and operations business
            analyst at AllLife, business analyst and communications manager at
            1Life, marketing coordinator and marketing assistant at Sanlam,
            sales administrator and assistant to broker at Dave Pohl &
            Associates, financial advisor at Sanlam Wealth Agency, marketing
            coordinator at SecureData, and academic sales representative at
            Pearson Education South Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was on the management committee at 1Life and AllLife from April
            2010 to April 2017, during which I establishing the business
            analysis capability at both companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led a team of nine business analysts at Nedbank who were allocated
            to long-standing agile teams across various digital transformation
            projects. My responsibilities were to encourage cross-team
            collaboration, knowledge sharing and reuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also led teams informally to transition recruits into new
            roles that I moved away from. I handed over the communications
            function to a new team of four employees at 1Life to transition into
            the business analysis role.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since June 2023, I started expanding my skills to include full stack
            web development, game development and digital art to name but a few.
